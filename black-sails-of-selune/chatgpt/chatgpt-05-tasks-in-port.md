### How the Tasks Can Tie Together:
Each role brings something crucial to the heist preparation. The **Second Mate** might gain insight into enemy forces, while the **Navigator** ensures there’s a safe escape route. The **Gun Captain** and **Powder Monkey** focus on arming the ship for battle, and the **Surgeon** ensures the crew survives any skirmishes. Meanwhile, the **Cook** keeps morale high and gathers crucial information from the local populace. Together, these tasks give the players a dynamic way to engage with the port while preparing for the heist, and each player's success (or failure) in their role could have significant impacts on the mission’s outcome.
