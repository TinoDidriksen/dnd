## D&D Adventure: *"Mutiny in the Stars"*

### Introduction:
The adventurers are crew members aboard the **Void Reaver**, a feared pirate Spelljammer captained by the ruthless and cunning **Vira Bloodwake**. For years, they have pillaged the Astral Sea under her leadership, raiding merchant ships, battling rival pirates, and even clashing with law enforcement from major Wildspace cities. Now, Captain Bloodwake is planning her greatest heist yet—the theft of the legendary **Tears of Selûne**, a powerful artifact capable of controlling the Astral winds.

However, not all is well aboard the Void Reaver. Captain Bloodwake has become increasingly paranoid, and whispers of mutiny have started to spread among the crew. The adventurers must decide whether to remain loyal to the Captain or seize the opportunity to overthrow her and claim the Void Reaver as their own.

### Background:
Captain Vira Bloodwake has built her reputation as one of the deadliest pirates in Wildspace, leading the Void Reaver on daring raids and earning the loyalty—or fear—of her crew. But the promise of the **Tears of Selûne** has consumed her. Bloodwake believes that with the Tears, she can bend Wildspace itself to her will, creating her own pirate empire. The adventurers, having served her for years, know her ruthless ambition, and now face a choice: will they help her steal the artifact, or betray her to claim the Void Reaver for themselves?

### Part 1: Life Aboard the Void Reaver

#### Setting:
The adventure begins aboard the Void Reaver, a sleek and ominous Spelljammer vessel that sails the Astral Sea. The ship is filled with pirate crew members of varying loyalty, from hardened veterans to recent recruits. The ship itself is an extension of Bloodwake’s power—arcane runes pulse along its hull, giving it the ability to phase in and out of the Astral Plane.

The adventurers are given roles aboard the Void Reaver depending on their backgrounds. They may be trusted officers, the ship’s enforcers, or more recent additions looking to rise through the ranks. Either way, their loyalty to Bloodwake will be tested.

#### Initial Mission:
Bloodwake summons the adventurers to her quarters and informs them of their next mission: a raid on the merchant ship **Horizon’s Edge**, which is rumored to be carrying the Tears of Selûne. She lays out the plan—a brutal ambush in a secluded part of the **Shattered Belt** asteroid field. 

The adventurers have the chance to explore the ship, interact with other members of the crew, and learn of growing dissent among the ranks. Some crew members, such as **First Mate Zala** (Half-Orc Barbarian, CR 5), are fiercely loyal to Bloodwake, while others, like **Quartermaster Trellion** (Tiefling Rogue, CR 4), openly talk of mutiny.

#### Key NPCs:
- **First Mate Zala** (Half-Orc Barbarian, CR 5): Brutal and fiercely loyal to Bloodwake. She is suspicious of anyone who shows signs of disloyalty.
- **Quartermaster Trellion** (Tiefling Rogue, CR 4): Cynical and opportunistic, Trellion has been sowing seeds of rebellion among the crew.
- **Shipwright Mox (Goblin Artificer, CR 2)**: The ship's mechanic, who is neutral but would follow whoever maintains control of the Void Reaver.
- **Navigator Sundara** (Elf Mage, CR 5): Quiet and secretive, Sundara has her own agenda and could be swayed to either side.

### Part 2: The Raid on Horizon’s Edge

#### Setting:
The Void Reaver emerges from the swirling mist of the **Shattered Belt**, preparing to ambush the **Horizon’s Edge**, a massive merchant vessel carrying valuable cargo and the Tears of Selûne. The adventurers are assigned key roles in the attack, leading boarding parties or disabling the ship’s defenses.

#### Combat Encounter:
The players will lead the assault on the Horizon’s Edge, which includes battling the ship’s guards and navigating its labyrinthine cargo hold to find the artifact. However, the defenders, led by **Captain Sareth Ulmara** (Human Veteran, CR 3), are well-prepared and fight fiercely to protect their valuable cargo.

- 10 **Merchant Guards** (CR 1/2)
- 1 **Captain Sareth Ulmara** (Human Veteran, CR 3)
- 2 **Arcane Cannoneers** (CR 2): Spellcasters stationed on the Horizon’s Edge who use ship-mounted arcane artillery.

#### Decision Point:
During the raid, the adventurers discover that Captain Bloodwake’s plan is more dangerous than they anticipated. She intends to use the Tears of Selûne to bind the ship to the Astral Plane permanently, ensuring that it can never be captured—but this will also cost the lives of many of the crew.

At this point, the players face their first major decision:
- **Remain Loyal**: They can continue to serve Bloodwake, ensuring the success of her plan to capture the Tears and elevate her to power.
- **Mutiny**: They can use the chaos of the raid to strike against Bloodwake, starting a mutiny aboard the Void Reaver.

### Part 3: Mutiny or Loyalty?

#### Mutiny Path:

If the players choose to mutiny, they will need to gather allies from among the crew, convincing key NPCs such as Quartermaster Trellion and Shipwright Mox to support them. They will also need to deal with First Mate Zala, who remains fiercely loyal to Bloodwake. Zala will attempt to rally the crew to crush the rebellion before it gains momentum.

- **Skill Challenges**: Players must use **Persuasion** or **Intimidation** to convince crew members to join the mutiny. They can also use **Deception** to sabotage Bloodwake’s defenses or steal her private stock of arcane explosives to rig key parts of the ship.
- **Confrontation with Zala**: The mutiny culminates in a confrontation with First Mate Zala. This battle takes place in the ship’s engine room, where the Void Reaver’s arcane core hums with dangerous power. The environment becomes unstable during the fight, with bursts of magical energy damaging anyone who gets too close to the core.

#### Combat Encounter:
- **First Mate Zala** (Half-Orc Barbarian, CR 5): A relentless fighter who uses her rage to protect Bloodwake’s control of the ship.
- 6 **Loyal Crew Members** (CR 1/2): Pirates who remain loyal to Bloodwake and Zala.

After defeating Zala, the adventurers will need to confront Bloodwake herself. This fight is not just about physical combat—it’s also about strategy. Bloodwake has an intimate connection to the ship and can use the Void Reaver’s arcane energies to her advantage.

#### Final Showdown with Bloodwake:
The adventurers face off against Bloodwake in her throne room, a chamber of swirling Astral energy connected to the helm of the ship. Here, she wields the Tears of Selûne, using it to warp the very space around them.

- **Captain Vira Bloodwake** (Human Archmage, CR 10): Bloodwake uses powerful spells and manipulates the ship’s environment to gain the upper hand. She can summon tendrils of Astral energy, teleport across the battlefield, and unleash devastating area-of-effect spells.

#### Combat Environment Hazards:
The Void Reaver is unstable during the fight. Periodically, rifts in space open, pulling crew members or objects into the Astral Plane. These rifts can be avoided with Dexterity saving throws, but they add a layer of chaos to the battle.

If the players succeed, they will defeat Bloodwake and claim the Tears of Selûne. They can now take control of the Void Reaver, becoming its new captains.

---

#### Loyalty Path:

If the players remain loyal, they assist Bloodwake in completing her plan to capture the Tears of Selûne. They help repel mutinous crew members, defeat treacherous officers like Trellion, and defend the Void Reaver from external threats, such as a Wildspace navy patrol that arrives in pursuit of the pirates.

- **Confrontation with Trellion**: The mutiny, led by Quartermaster Trellion, turns violent. The players must fight their former comrades in a brutal battle aboard the Void Reaver’s decks. Trellion has sabotaged key systems, and the players must stop him before the ship is torn apart.

#### Final Assault:
The final battle takes place not against Bloodwake but alongside her, as the Void Reaver is pursued by the **Celestial Navy**, a group of Wildspace enforcers intent on capturing Bloodwake and her crew. The players defend the ship while Bloodwake harnesses the power of the Tears to escape through a portal into a distant part of Wildspace.

#### Combat Encounter:
- **Celestial Navy Captain Atrius** (Aasimar Paladin, CR 7): A powerful naval officer determined to bring Bloodwake to justice.
- 8 **Celestial Marines** (CR 3): Soldiers armed with radiant weapons and protective armor.

If the players successfully defend the ship, Bloodwake rewards them with positions of power and access to the vast wealth the Tears of Selûne will bring.

### Part 4: Conclusion

#### Mutiny Ending:
If the adventurers overthrow Bloodwake and take control of the Void Reaver, they become the new leaders of the pirate crew. With the Tears of Selûne in their possession, they are poised to become the most powerful pirates in Wildspace. However, they will soon find that power comes with its own set of challenges. Rival pirate factions, bounty hunters, and Wildspace navies will hunt them down for control of the Tears of Selûne. Their newfound reign as captains of the Void Reaver could lead to fortune and fame—or a swift and brutal downfall. The adventurers will have to decide how to wield their power and maintain loyalty among the crew as other threats close in.

#### Loyalty Ending:
If the adventurers remain loyal to Captain Bloodwake and help her secure the Tears of Selûne, they solidify their place in her inner circle. Bloodwake, now armed with the ability to control the Astral winds, begins her campaign to dominate Wildspace. The adventurers, as her trusted officers, stand to gain riches, influence, and the thrill of ruling the stars. But as Bloodwake's ambitions grow, they may find themselves questioning whether they should have taken the opportunity to seize power for themselves.

This adventure allows the players to explore the dynamics of pirate life in the vastness of Wildspace, offering intense combat, intrigue, and the chance to shape their own destiny.
