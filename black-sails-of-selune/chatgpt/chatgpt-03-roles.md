Prompt: What positions on the Void Reaver could the players occupy at the start?

The players can occupy various key positions aboard the **Void Reaver**, giving them authority and specific duties within the pirate crew. These roles come with responsibilities that allow them to interact with different aspects of the ship and crew, and they can also influence how the story unfolds, particularly if a mutiny occurs.

Here are some potential roles the players could hold at the start:

### 1. **First Mate**
   - **Role**: Second-in-command, responsible for maintaining order among the crew and executing the captain's commands. The first mate oversees daily operations and ensures the crew follows through on tasks. They are often in charge of discipline and settling disputes.
   - **Potential Hook**: A player in this role may be fiercely loyal to Captain Bloodwake or harbor secret ambitions to take the helm themselves. They would have a crucial role in organizing a mutiny—or in defending the Captain.
   
### 2. **Quartermaster**
   - **Role**: In charge of supplies, treasure, and distribution of loot. The quartermaster ensures the crew is well-provisioned and that everyone gets a fair share of the plunder. This role is essential for keeping the crew happy and preventing discontent.
   - **Potential Hook**: The quartermaster could be tempted to sway the crew in a mutiny, especially if they feel the Captain is keeping too much of the treasure or putting the crew in unnecessary danger.

### 3. **Navigator**
   - **Role**: Responsible for plotting courses through Wildspace and navigating the Astral Sea. The navigator uses star charts, magical instruments, and Spelljammer lore to avoid hazards like black holes, asteroid fields, and hostile ships.
   - **Potential Hook**: A navigator might feel like they are the real brains of the operation, guiding the ship through perilous space while the Captain gets all the glory. They could be persuaded to join a rebellion if they believe they could guide the crew to even greater riches.

### 4. **Boatswain (Bosun)**
   - **Role**: Responsible for the maintenance and repair of the ship. The boatswain oversees the deckhands and ensures the ship remains in working order after battle damage or cosmic wear. They may also be in charge of boarding and raiding parties during combat.
   - **Potential Hook**: The boatswain could have strong opinions about how the ship is run—especially if Captain Bloodwake's recent obsession with the **Tears of Selûne** leads to reckless engagements that put the ship at risk. They could either rally the crew against her or work to preserve the ship in a loyalist role.

### 5. **Gunner**
   - **Role**: Oversees the ship’s weaponry, such as ballistae, catapults, or arcane cannons. The gunner directs the crew during space combat and ensures that the ship's weapon systems are in top condition.
   - **Potential Hook**: The gunner might be hungry for combat or glory but could also grow weary of the endless raids if it feels like the crew is taking unnecessary risks. They could sway the outcome of a mutiny by controlling the ship's firepower.

### 6. **Helmsman**
   - **Role**: Pilots the ship by attuning to the Spelljammer helm, a magical device that allows control over the ship’s movement through Wildspace and the Astral Sea. The helmsman is key to steering the Void Reaver into and out of danger.
   - **Potential Hook**: As the one literally steering the ship, the helmsman holds immense power and could tip the balance in any mutiny. They may feel indispensable and thus entitled to more than their fair share of loot—or even leadership of the crew.

### 7. **Surgeon/Healer**
   - **Role**: Tends to the wounds and ailments of the crew. This could be a mundane healer, an alchemist, or even a cleric or druid who uses magic to keep the crew in fighting shape. They may also be knowledgeable about poisons, curses, and other spacefaring dangers.
   - **Potential Hook**: The surgeon could be loyal to Captain Bloodwake due to a personal bond or because they believe she will lead them to greater treasure. Alternatively, they may be sick of patching up crew members after reckless missions and could side with a mutiny to ensure the crew's survival.

### 8. **Master of Sails**
   - **Role**: Oversees the rigging and sails (or magical equivalents) of the Void Reaver. In Spelljammer ships, the sails often channel magical energy, so this position involves maintaining both physical and arcane control over the ship's speed and direction.
   - **Potential Hook**: The master of sails could feel directly responsible for the ship’s success in battle and maneuvering, believing their expertise makes them a strong candidate for leadership. Alternatively, they might stay loyal to the Captain in the belief that she best knows how to command the stars.

### 9. **Lookout**
   - **Role**: Stationed in the crow’s nest or similar vantage point, responsible for spotting dangers like asteroids, rival ships, or space anomalies before they become a threat. They might also be responsible for sensing shifts in the Astral winds or other magical phenomena.
   - **Potential Hook**: A lookout might grow frustrated with the Captain's dangerous pursuits, especially if they’ve seen too many close calls. They could secretly pass information to mutineers or act as a spy, feeding key intel to either side of a conflict.

### 10. **Arcane Specialist/Ship Mage**
   - **Role**: Maintains the magical aspects of the ship, such as shields, arcane engines, or offensive spells used during space combat. They may also act as a strategic advisor to Captain Bloodwake, utilizing their magic to secure victory during raids.
   - **Potential Hook**: An arcane specialist might see themselves as more than just a tool for the Captain's ambitions and could be swayed by the promise of greater personal power. On the other hand, if they believe in Bloodwake’s vision, they could become one of her fiercest defenders.

### Other Crew Positions:
1. **Swabbie** (New recruit or low-ranking deckhand)
2. **Powder Monkey** (Assistant to the gunner, responsible for handling ammunition)
3. **Cook** (Responsible for feeding the crew, a lowly but potentially influential role)
4. **Boarding Party Leader** (An elite fighter or rogue specializing in raiding other ships)

### Choosing Roles for the Players:
These positions give players unique responsibilities and relationships aboard the Void Reaver. Depending on their role, they’ll have different reasons to stay loyal to Bloodwake or plot against her. Higher-ranked roles like First Mate or Quartermaster offer more power and influence, while positions like Boatswain or Gunner give players control over critical ship functions in battle.

Each of these roles also allows players to interact with the ship in ways that directly impact the story, making their choices feel meaningful whether they support the Captain or lead the mutiny.
